    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This peach jam recipe for fragrant preserves is simple to make and may be stored.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>12 fresh peaches, pitted and chopped</li>
        <li>4 Â½ cups white sugar</li>
        <li>1 (2 ounce) package dry pectin</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Crush 1 cup of chopped peaches in the bottom of a large saucepan. 
                Add remaining peaches and set the pan over medium-low heat. 
                Bring to a low boil and cook until peaches become liquid with a 
                few bits of peach left, about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour cooked peaches into a bowl, then measure 6 cups peaches back 
                into the pan. Add sugar and bring to a boil over medium heat. 
                Gradually stir in dry pectin; boil for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and pack jam into hot, sterilized jars, 
                filling to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a clean knife or 
                thin spatula around the insides of the jars to remove any air bubbles. 
                Wipe rims with a moist paper towel to remove any residue.</li>
                <li>Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil and lower jars 2 inches apart into the boiling water using a holder. Pour in more boiling water to cover jars by at least 1 inch. Bring to a rolling boil, cover, and process for 10 minutes. Carefully remove jars from stockpot and let jam cool, then store on a shelf in a cool, dark place.</li>
        </ol>
